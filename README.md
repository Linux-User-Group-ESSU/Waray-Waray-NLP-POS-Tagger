# Waray Parts-Of-Speech Tagger using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

## Activities to be done:
1. - [x] Make a dataset from untagged articles 
    1. computerized tagging or Manual tagging
       - [x] Each article will be tagged using a program that will try to compare \.
       the already tagged words and saved into a different file.
       - [x] The saved filed will be validated manually (Wrong tags will be changed appropriately) 
2. - [x] Train the HMM model using KFold Cross Validation to prevent biases of the data when training and testing.
3. <del> - [x] Test the accuracy of the HMM model using the testing dataset(10% of the dataset) </del>
4. - [x] Need more data.
