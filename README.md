Project Title: Waray Parts-Of-Speech Tagger using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

Activities to be done:
    1. Make a dataset from untagged articles (Step 1. computerized tagging; Step 2. manual tagging)
        a. Each article will be tagged using a program that will try to compare the already tagged words
           and saved into a different file.
        b. The saved filed will be validated manually (Wrong tags will be changed appropriately) 
    2. Train the HMM model using training dataset (90% of the dataset)
    3. Test the accuracy of the HMM model using the testing dataset(10% of the dataset)
